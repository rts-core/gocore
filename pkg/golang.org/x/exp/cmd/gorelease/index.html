		<p>
gorelease is an experimental tool that helps module authors avoid common
problems before releasing a new version of a module.
</p>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>gorelease [-base={version|none}] [-version=version]
</pre>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre># Compare with the latest version and suggest a new version.
gorelease

# Compare with a specific version and suggest a new version.
gorelease -base=v1.2.3

# Compare with the latest version and check a specific new version for compatibility.
gorelease -version=v1.3.0

# Compare with a specific version and check a specific new version for compatibility.
gorelease -base=v1.2.3 -version=v1.3.0
</pre>
<p>
gorelease analyzes changes in the public API and dependencies of the main
module. It compares a base version (set with -base) with the currently
checked out revision. Given a proposed version to release (set with
-version), gorelease reports whether the changes are consistent with
semantic versioning. If no version is proposed with -version, gorelease
suggests the lowest version consistent with semantic versioning.
</p>
<p>
If there are no visible changes in the module&#39;s public API, gorelease
accepts versions that increment the minor or patch version numbers. For
example, if the base version is &#34;v2.3.1&#34;, gorelease would accept &#34;v2.3.2&#34; or
&#34;v2.4.0&#34; or any prerelease of those versions, like &#34;v2.4.0-beta&#34;. If no
version is proposed, gorelease would suggest &#34;v2.3.2&#34;.
</p>
<p>
If there are only backward compatible differences in the module&#39;s public
API, gorelease only accepts versions that increment the minor version. For
example, if the base version is &#34;v2.3.1&#34;, gorelease would accept &#34;v2.4.0&#34;
but not &#34;v2.3.2&#34;.
</p>
<p>
If there are incompatible API differences for a proposed version with
major version 1 or higher, gorelease will exit with a non-zero status.
Incompatible differences may only be released in a new major version, which
requires creating a module with a different path. For example, if
incompatible changes are made in the module &#34;example.com/mod&#34;, a
new major version must be released as a new module, &#34;example.com/mod/v2&#34;.
For a proposed version with major version 0, which allows incompatible
changes, gorelease will describe all changes, but incompatible changes
will not affect its exit status.
</p>
<p>
For more information on semantic versioning, see <a href="https://semver.org.">https://semver.org.</a>
</p>
<p>
Note: gorelease does not accept build metadata in releases (like
v1.0.0+debug). Although it is valid semver, the Go tool and other tools in
the ecosystem do not support it, so its use is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
gorelease accepts the following flags:
</p>
<p>
-base=version: The version that the current version of the module will be
compared against. This may be a version like &#34;v1.5.2&#34;, a version query like
&#34;latest&#34;, or &#34;none&#34;. If the version is &#34;none&#34;, gorelease will not compare the
current version against any previous version; it will only validate the
current version. This is useful for checking the first release of a new major
version. The version may be preceded by a different module path and an &#39;@&#39;,
like -base=example.com/mod/v2@v2.5.2. This is useful to compare against
an earlier major version or a fork. If -base is not specified, gorelease will
attempt to infer a base version from the -version flag and available released
versions.
</p>
<p>
-version=version: The proposed version to be released. If specified,
gorelease will confirm whether this version is consistent with changes made
to the module&#39;s public API. gorelease will exit with a non-zero status if the
version is not valid.
</p>
<p>
gorelease is eventually intended to be merged into the go command
as &#34;go release&#34;. See golang.org/issues/26420.
